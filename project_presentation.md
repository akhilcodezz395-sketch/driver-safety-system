## 1. Introduction
The **Smart Road Early Warning System** is an innovative mobile application designed to enhance driver safety on hazardous road segments.

*   **Core Function**: Detects sharp curves and road anomalies in real-time.
*   **Technology**: Utilizes standard smartphone sensors (GPS, Accelerometer, Gyroscope) combined with Machine Learning.
*   **Interaction**: Provides immediate haptic (vibration) and visual alerts to the driver *before* they enter a danger zone.
*   **Goal**: To reduce accidents caused by speeding on unfamiliar or curved roads.

## 2. Motivation
*   **High Accident Rates**: Curves and hilly terrains are hotspots for vehicle rollovers and loss-of-control accidents.
*   **Cost Factor**: Traditional Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) require expensive, dedicated hardware (LiDAR, Radar).
*   **Accessibility**: Almost every driver owns a smartphone, making this a zero-cost safety upgrade for the masses.
*   **Data-Driven**: Leveraging AI to learn from driving patterns rather than static rules improves accuracy over time.

## 3. Objectives
*   To develop a **cost-effective** driver warning system using readily available smartphone hardware.
*   To implement **Machine Learning algorithms** (TensorFlow Lite) on the edge for real-time curve severity classification.
*   To ensure **low-latency alerts** that give drivers sufficient reaction time.
*   To create a **distraction-free interface** that relies primarily on haptic feedback.

## 4. Scope & Significance
*   **Target Audience**: Daily commuters, truck fleet operators, and tourists navigating unfamiliar routes.
*   **Scalability**: The software-only approach allows for rapid deployment to millions of devices without manufacturing overhead.
*   **Infrastructure Diagnostic**: Aggregated data can help road authorities identify dangerous spots that need physical signage or repair.

## 5. Literature Review (Part 1)

| Paper / Study | Key Insight |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Low-cost realtime horizontal curve detection (IEEE 2016)** | Used accelerometer/gyro to model curves with 93.8% accuracy, proving low-cost sensors are viable. |
| **2. Evaluation of curve speed warning system (CDC 2022)** | Found that dynamic warnings reduce curve entry speeds by 4-7 mph, significantly lowering rollover risk. |
| **3. Vibrotactile Patterns for ADAS (ResearchGate)** | Haptic feedback (vibration) resulted in 20% faster reaction times compared to visual-only alerts. |
| **4. Estimation of Road Curvature from GPS (Wang et al.)** | Proposed mathematical models to derive curve radius purely from raw GPS coordinates. |
| **5. Smartphone-based driver behavior profiling (IEEE Access)** | Used sensor fusion to classify driving styles (Aggressive vs. Safe) with 85% accuracy. |

1.  **Input Layer**: Captures raw sensor data at 10Hz.
2.  **Processing Layer**: Computes features (speed, bearing change, lateral acceleration) and runs the Neural Network.
3.  **Output Layer**: Triggers vibration patterns based on severity (Mild, Urgent, Hectic).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 7. Methodology (App Working)
1.  **Trip Initiation**: Driver launches the app and inputs the destination (optional). The app begins monitoring in the background.
2.  **Sensor Data Acquisition**: The app continuously reads data from the **Accelerometer**, **Gyroscope**, and **GPS** sensors at a frequency of 10Hz.
3.  **Real-time Feature Extraction**: Raw sensor data is buffered into 3-second sliding windows. Key features (speed, bearing change, lateral g-force) are computed locally on the device.
4.  **On-Device Inference**: The extracted features are fed into the embedded **TensorFlow Lite model**, which classifies the current driving state (Safe, Mild Curve, Sharp Curve).
5.  **Alert Generation**: If a dangerous curve is detected:
    *   **Haptic Engine** triggers a specific vibration pattern.
    *   **Visual UI** flashes a warning color (Orange/Red) on the screen.
6.  **Feedback Loop**: The system continues to monitor for the next window, ensuring continuous protection throughout the drive.

## 8. Data Simulation & Visualization (Current Progress)
As part of the **Preprocessing Stage**, we have successfully simulated driving scenarios to validate our feature extraction logic.

![Data Preview](data_preview.png)

*   **Top Graph**: Simulated GPS path showing both straight segments and sharp curves.
*   **Bottom Graph**: Corresponding sensor readings. Note the spikes in **Lateral Acceleration (Red)** and **Yaw Rate (Green)** during curve events, which our algorithm detects.

## 8. Technical Feasibility
*   **Hardware Agnostic**: Runs on any Android device with standard sensors (Android 8.0+).
*   **Edge Computing**: All processing happens locally on the phone. No internet connection is required for the core safety features, ensuring reliability in remote areas.
*   **Battery Efficiency**: Optimized sensor polling and lightweight model inference minimize power drain.

## 9. Components & Tech Stack
*   **Language**: 
    *   **Kotlin** (Android App Development)
    *   **Python** (Data Analysis & Model Training)
*   **Libraries**:
    *   **TensorFlow Lite**: On-device Machine Learning.
    *   **Google Maps SDK**: Route visualization.
